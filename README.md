# Minesweeper Interview Exercise

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game, and this project is a console-based implementation created as part of a coding interview exercise. The game is built using C# and follows best practices in coding and design.

## Features

- **8x8 Grid**: The game board consists of an 8x8 grid filled with hidden mines (customizable inside the code).
- **10 Mines**: There are 10 mines randomly placed on the board (customizable inside the code).
- **User Interaction**: Players reveal cells by entering coordinates, aiming to avoid the hidden mines.
- **Win/Lose Conditions**: The game ends with a victory if all safe cells are revealed or a loss if a mine is triggered.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Compile and run the program.
2. **Enter Coordinates**: The game will prompt you to enter the X and Y coordinates of the cell you want to reveal.
3. **Avoid the Mines**: If you reveal a mine, the game ends with a loss.
4. **Reveal All Safe Cells**: The goal is to reveal all cells that don't contain a mine.

## Conclusion

This Minesweeper project is a coding exercise for an interview process. It demonstrates clean architecture, thoughtful design, and adherence to best practices. Enjoy exploring the code and playing the game!
